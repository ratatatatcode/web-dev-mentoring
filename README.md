**Web Development Mentoring**<br>
This project provides a comprehensive guide to building a full-stack web application using Express.js, EJS, and Firebase. It focuses on applying CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage data efficiently.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js with Express.js for backend routing and server handling
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for dynamic HTML rendering
- Firebase for user authentication and database storage

**Features:**
- Implement CRUD operations to manage tasks in the app.
- User authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their own to-do list.
- Create a fully functional To-Do app where users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have built a simple but useful **To-Do app with user authentication**, using basic web development skills and modern tools.
